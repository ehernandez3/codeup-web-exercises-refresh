            <!-- EXERCISES -->

                    <!-- For this exercise, we will continue working with the welcome.html file.
                        We will talk about the syntax of css selectors and properties in the next
                        lesson, but for now, use the examples above to complete the exercise. 
                
                        1. Use a style attribute to set the font color of the h1 element to red.

                        2. Add a class of "fancy-header" to your h1 element, and create an embedded
                        stylesheet and based on the example above. What color is the h1 after creating
                        the embedded stylesheet? Remove the style attribute from your h1 and view the 
                        page again.
                        
                        3. Create a directory named css in your project. Within this directory,
                        create a file named style.css, and include a link to it in your html document.

                        4. Inside of style.css, copy the above css, but change to font color to purple.
                        What color is the h1 after making this change? Remove your embedded stylesheet
                        and view the page again.
                        
                        5. What do the above exercises tell you about the precedence of style attributes
                        and embedded and external stylesheets?
                        
                        6. Remove any style attributes and embedded stylesheets. From this point forward,
                        we will only be working with external stylesheets.
                        
                        7. Finally, commit the changes to your git repository, and push to GitHub.
